# This practical aims to familiarise you with the similarities and differences between C++ and Java.

The nation of Dystopia has a lot of problems…and also a lot of “Super” Heroes to “fix” them. You have joined
the Dystopian Hero Acquisition Ministry (D-HAM, or HAM for short). As a Computer Scientist in
HAM, your superiors believe you can assist in modernising the HAM’s tools used to manage the request for
heroes during crisis situations. Your first job (to bring home the proverbial bacon) is to improve an old program
that scrambles super hero names for internal and external use. (Note: The scrambling of names is necessary to
keep the locations and identities of heroes a secret. In reality the heroes just want less fan mail.)
The HAM currently uses a C++ program that scrambles all hero names into an unreadable form, and then
converts them back for other HAM employees using the program. This program is not viable as the HAM
needs a program that can be deployed onto any of its available devices. Your job is to convert the old C++
program into a Java program for the HAM.
The HAM has provided you with the following to facilitate your development:
• Existing C++ Code - The complete and working C++ program in use by the HAM (available under the
additional files section on eve).
• Examples of how names can be scrambled and unscrambled.
Your Java program must be able to:
• scramble (Hero Name to Unreadable Text)
• unscramble (Unreadable Text to Hero Name)
