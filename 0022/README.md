## Description

Imagine that there is a number of cities you want to visit, but because of budget contraints, you want to visit all the cities in an order that minimizes the distance between the cities, therefor the cost. 

How do you go about doing that?

For the sake of simplicity, lets just say there are three cities your want to visit. Well, there are 3! possible combinations, but which of these combinations will result in the shortest distance between the cities.

This algorithm continously tries all the combinations until a combination with the shortest distance is found.
